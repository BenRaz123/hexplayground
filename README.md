# Hex Playground

## What is this?

This is a website where you can enter hex codes and see the background update _instantly_!

## Why

I did not see any good alternatives

## NEW in 2024: Custom Starting Colors

The default behavior when hexplayground is opened is to show a random color. This is still the case, however, you can change the color shown by setting the `?color=` URL parameter. The value can be a hex code or a valid css color name.

### Example:

This link: <https://benraz.dev/hexplayground?color=black> will always start on black no matter what.
